      question: "What are the cheapest days to fly to Anywhere?",
      answer:
        "When booking a flight to Anywhere, play around with flight options and dates in the map to identify the cheapest times to travel. Price history and real-time insights can also tell you if a fare is lower or higher than usual. If you already have a specific destination in mind, you can track prices and get notified if the fare drops. So, you don't have to worry about paying too much or missing out on the cheapest time to book. Off-peak travel is often more budget-friendly, so planning your trip during these times can lead to significant savings.",
